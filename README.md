(to compile the entire project, run 'make all'. To launch, use 'make run')

## Commands to install the necessary libraries to compile the game on Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev 
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev 
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```

## Controls within the cube interface

**Cube movements**:
* RLFBUD: are the face movements in a clockwise direction (lowercase letters for counterclockwise movements)
* XYZxyz: rotations of the entire cube (uppercase for clockwise, lowercase for counterclockwise)
* MESmes: move the middle layers

All these movements are considered standard and are known as [Singmaster notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_notation) – although we use uppercase or lowercase letters for clockwise or counterclockwise movements, respectively.

**Additionally, you can use**:
* w: randomly selects one of the scrambles from the scrambles.txt file and resets the timer
* W: uses the algorithm from solver.c to generate a string that solves the cube, executes it all at once, and prints the solved cube
* A: displays the string generated by solver.h on the screen; if it doesn't fit all at once, you can see the next part of the solution by pressing 'A' again
* a: solves the cube by executing each move with a small delay before each one so you can see on the screen how the algorithm solves the cube
* space: stops/resets the timer. If the cube is solved, a message appears on the screen, which can be dismissed by pressing any key.

**Only in the terminal interface**:
* q: exits the interface
* o: clears the terminal and reprints the content in case of any errors. Intended for use with `CTRL`+`+` or `CTRL`+`-`, and then using `o` to refresh the screen.

**Only in the SDL library interface**:
* ESC: exits the interface
